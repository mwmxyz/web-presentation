## What this contains and doesn't contain

> - [ ] Full click-through access to playable or more complete versions of exercises listed
> - [x] A use of GitHub coded per the instructions from a Jekyll theme (properly credited in the last slide)
> - [x] Curated exercises (the ones that contributed to skills I actually use at work)
