#### What this contains and doesn't contain

- [x] Pictorial examples as proof of work
- [ ] A coherent logic to the spatial navigation system (arrows)
- [x] A use of GitHub coded per the instructions from a Jekyll theme (properly credited in the last slide)
- [x] Curated exercises (the ones that contributed to skills I actually use at work)
