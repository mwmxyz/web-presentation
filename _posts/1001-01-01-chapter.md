## Face Cards

The first thing that I'm proud of making is this comic strip, horribly drawn by hand, and then some of the FaNcIeSt image manipulation so that a pair of playing cards can have a conversation about card games, interrupted by a Magic the Gathering card. This is inspired by Scott McCloud's piece on Chess, and even more by his Understanding Comics (et. al.)
