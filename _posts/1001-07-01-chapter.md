Voyant Analysis of texts about children's singing games (Ex #8)

- [x] I learned that I don't know much about data analysis
- [ ] I took my newfound motivation and bettered myself with free online trainings to grow this skillset
- [x] I learned that Morettian distance reading does not work the same way with games as it does with books 
- [x] I found another place where I have to do more than copy-paste to get good results out of AI image generators
